I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ucl-computer-science) at University College London (UCL), advised by Professor [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). After three years in industry, I have returned to academia to pursue my passion for research. I previously received my M.Sc. in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning ([CSML]((https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning-msc))) from UCL.

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, and Large Language Models. And yes, I proudly identify as a Bayesianist!

If you’d like to discuss potential collaborations or shared research interests, feel free to contact me at yan.song.24@ucl.ac.uk.

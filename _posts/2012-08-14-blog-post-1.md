### On the Implications of Verbose LLM Outputs: A Case Study in Translation Evaluation
*Eleftheria Briakou, Zhongtao Liu, Colin Cherry, Markus Freitag (Google)*

In machine translation, verbosity is bad and prevalent. The paper conduct exploration of what causing verbosity and how it affect evalution.

KeyWord:  NLP

### Quantifying reliance on external information over parametric knowledge during Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using mechanistic analysis
*Reshmi Ghosh, Rahul Seetharaman, Hitesh Wadhwa, Somyaa Aggarwal, Samyadeep Basu, Soundararajan Srinivasan, Wenlong Zhao, Shreyas Chaudhari, Ehsan Aghazadeh (Microsoft, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, University of Maryland, College Park,)*

RAG-related LLM has shortcut to answer question using context information instead of model prior. The paper proposes three mechanistical way to identify how LLM utilize information: causal inference method, attention weight checking, and attention knockout (remove one attention edge and see how the performance degrade).

KeyWord: RAG

### ADDITION IS ALL YOU NEED FOR ENERGY-EFFICIENT LANGUAGE MODELS
*Hongyin Luo & Wei Sun (BitEnergy AI, Inc)*

Approximate tensor multiplication with integer addition. The paper do detailed computational complexity analysis. Achieve similar performance to full-scale model but use less energy.
 Worth reading.

KeyWord: computation complexity, hardward-level optimization

### Generative AI and Perceptual Harms: Who’s Suspected of using LLMs?
*Kowe Kadoma, Danaë Metaxa, Mor Naaman*

How much harm caused to users when others perceive or
suspect them of using AI. The paper have done social experiments to verify perceptual harms.

KeyWord: AI for social good

### Removing Distributional Discrepancies in Captions Improves Image-Text Alignment
*Yuheng Li, Haotian Liu, Mu Cai, Yijun Li, Eli Shechtman, Zhe Lin, Yong Jae Lee, Krishna Kumar Singh (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Adobe Research)*

Solve the data inbalance problem in image-text alignment problems, by generating negative samples from the positive.

KeyWord: data augmentation

### Aligning Human and LLM Judgments: Insights from EvalAssist on Task-Specific Evaluations and AI-assisted Assessment Strategy Preferences
*Zahra Ashktorab, Michael Desmond, Qian Pan, James M. Johnson, Martin Santillan Cooper, Elizabeth M. Daly, Rahul Nair, Tejaswini Pedapati, Swapnaja Achintalwar, Werner Geyer (IBM)*

The paper investigate how human behave as an evaluator for LLLM's outputs, trying to understand what practitioners prioritize in evaluation criteria when using LLMs as judges and how these priorities differ. The paper also provide a tool to help practitioners refine evaluation criteria using both direct and pairwise assessment strategies.

KeyWord: Trustworthy AI, human-AI interaction
